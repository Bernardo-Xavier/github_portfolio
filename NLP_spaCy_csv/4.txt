The AIDA plan is tailor-made for using the indirect approach, allowing you to save your main idea for the action phase. However, you can also use AIDA for the direct approach, in which case you use your main idea as an attention-getter, build interest with your argument, create desire with your evidence, and re-emphasize your main idea in the action phase with the specific action you want your audience to take.  When your AIDA message uses an indirect approach and is delivered by email, keep in mind that your subject line usually catches your reader’s eye first. Your challenge is to make it interesting and relevant enough to capture reader attention without revealing your main idea. If you put your request in the subject line, you’re likely to get a quick “no” before you’ve had a chance to present your arguments.
