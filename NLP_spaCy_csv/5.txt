A negative message using the direct approach opens with the bad news, proceeds to the reasons for the situation or the decision, and ends with a positive statement aimed at maintaining a good relationship with the audience. Depending on the circumstances, the message may also offer alternatives or a plan of action to fix the situation under discussion. Stating bad news at the beginning can have two advantages: (1) it makes a shorter message possible, and (2) it allows the audience to reach the main idea of the message in less time.  The indirect approach helps the audience prepare for the bad news by presenting the reasons for it first. However, the indirect approach is not meant to obscure bad news, delay it, or limit your responsibility. Rather, the purpose of this approach is to ease the blow and help readers accept the situation. When done poorly, the indirect approach can be disrespectful and even unethical. But when done well, it is a good example of audience-oriented communication crafted with attention to both ethics and etiquette.  Messages using the indirect approach open with a buffer, a neutral, noncontroversial statement that establishes common.  An effective buffer serves as a stepping stone to the next part of your message, in which you build up the explanations and information that will culminate in your negative message. The nature of the information you provide is similar to that of the direct approach—it depends on the audience and the situation—but the way you portray this information differs because your audience doesn’t know your conclusion yet.  An ideal explanation section leads readers to your conclusion before you actually say it. That is, before you actually say “no,” the reader has followed your line of reasoning and is ready for the answer. By giving your reasons effectively, you help maintain focus on the issues at hand and defuse the emotions that always accompany significantly bad news.
