The spontaneous categorizations that are continually made by and in our brains,
and that are deeply influenced not just by the language we are speaking but also by our
era, our culture, and our current frame of mind, are quite different from the standard
image, according to which categorization is the placing of various entities surrounding
us into preexistent and sharply-defined mental categories, somewhat as one sorts items
of clothing into the different drawers of a chest of drawers. Just as one can easily stick
one’s shirts into a physical drawer labeled “shirts”, so one would easily assign dogs to
the mental drawer labeled “dog”, cats to the nearby mental drawer labeled “cat”, and
so forth. Every entity in the world would fit intrinsically into one specific mental “box”
or “category”, and this would be the mental structure to which all the different entities
of the same type would be assigned. Thus all bridges in the world would be
unambiguously assigned to the box labeled “bridge”, all situations involving motion
would be assigned to the box labeled “move”, and all situations involving things
standing still would be assigned to the box labeled “stationary”. This mechanism of
“boxing” everything in the world would be both automatic and completely reliable, the
raison d’être of mental categories being to assign entities objectively to their proper
conceptual label in an objective, observer-independent fashion.
